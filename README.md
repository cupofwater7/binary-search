# binary-search


  Write a function that takes in a sorted array of integers as well as a target
  integer. The function should use the Binary Search algorithm to determine if
  the target integer is contained in the array and should return its index if it
  is, otherwise -1. If you're unfamiliar with Binary Search, we recommend watching the Conceptual
  Overview section of this question's video explanation before starting to code.
